# Functional requirements:
- Tagging the articles which may be of interest to the domain (like business, crime etc) which the journalist is interested in.
- Searching for news articles. The search is a free text search and additional filters as per the tags that the article is tagged with.
- The return list of articles should be in the chronological order (or reverse chronological order) of the published time.

- Following are the non-functional requirements
  - Our service needs to be highly available.
  - Acceptable latency of the system is 1sec for search results.
  - Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability); if a user doesnâ€™t see a recent published article for a while, it should be fine.
